            Hey! My name is Angelo and I am a senior at San Francisco State University undergoing a B.S in Computer
            Science. My interests include full-stack development in both web and mobile applications as I've had 
            previous Software Engineering internships involving that field. I have also participated in a few research assignments during my time
            in SFSU. Aside from coding, I was also a DII collegiate athlete in wrestling for my university.
            Upon graduating, I will be joining <a class="mouse" href="https://www.cisco.com/">Cisco Systems</a> as a full-time Software Engineer as part of their Supply Chain/Digital Products
            team! <br>
            <br>
